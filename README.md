This study systematically investigates the complementary strengths of lexicon-based rule systems and data-driven models (e.g., Naive Bayes, linear regression) in sentiment analysis. Through cross-dataset correlation analysis and fine-grained error pattern mining, it identifies critical trade-offs: lexicon methods offer transparent semantic interpretation but struggle with context-dependent nuances (e.g., sarcasm, implicit sentiment), while machine learning models excel in capturing data-driven patterns at the expense of interpretability.To reconcile this duality, we propose a dynamic weighted ensemble framework that integrates lexicon-based scoring, multinomial Naive Bayes, linear regression, and contextual extension modules. The adaptive weight allocation mechanism—grounded in both domain knowledge and empirical performance—enables synergistic fusion of lexicon interpretability and model generalizability. Specifically, the framework employs a hybrid loss function to optimize weights across diverse text genres, including social media conversations and product review corpora.Experimental validation across 1320  real-world text samples demonstrates that the ensemble framework maintains 89% of lexicon-based interpretability while achieving about 15% reduction in mean absolute error compared to single-model baselines. These findings highlight the framework’s utility in practical applications requiring both predictive accuracy and explainable sentiment analysis.
